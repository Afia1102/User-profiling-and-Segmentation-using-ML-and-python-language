This project focuses on analyzing user profiles to optimize targeted advertising campaigns. Leveraging Python and its data analytics ecosystem, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user demographics, behavior, and interests. Through visualization techniques, we gained insights into key demographic variables such as age, gender, education level, and income level, as well as user engagement metrics and common interests. Subsequently, we employed KMeans clustering to segment users into distinct groups based on a combination of demographics, online behavior, and engagement metrics. By computing mean values of numerical features and mode for categorical features within each cluster, we identified defining characteristics of each segment. This approach enables advertisers to tailor ad campaigns effectively, aligning content with user preferences and behavior for enhanced engagement and conversion rates.
